                <span>Let's get to the point.</span> I am a friendly, hard working individual with a passion for deconstructing and refining processes to maximise efficiency. My background in Computer Games Design and App Development means that I approach challenges in a methodical way, and I am able to deliver people focused solutions to aid usability and efficiency.            </p>
            <p>
                <span>I can help you.</span> I've delivered changes that have rocked the core of businesses. I've worked with companies that had handwritten records from the 1800's and left them with fully functional DMS and processes that secured them their Cyber Essentials certifcation in a matter of months. I've delivered booking systems with bespoke outputs to travel agents and licencees throughout Europe. I've upgraded Intranets to enable open communications and fostering inclusive cultures in the workplace.

                <h4>Fred. Olsen Ltd <span>April 23 - Present</span></h4>
                <h5>Systems Project Administrator <span class="badge anim">Current Position</span></h5>
                <p>
                    Under the Fred. Olsen Ltd umbrella, I have successfully ran numerous projects across the companies in the group, spanning various industries including Travel & Tourism, Renewable Energy and Software Development. I implemented and configured Zoho Expense across Fred. Olsen Travel, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines and Fred. Olsen Renewables working with the IT teams in the UK and Norway. I worked on the upgrade of the company intranet and spearheaded the rejuvination of the company-tailored content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built strong working relationships with the employees a Fred. Olsen Travel and supported the implementation of a bespoke iSell booking platform for their retail division. I became an SME and delivered training to FOT staff and licensees, promoting best practice within the booking system. I managed the BAU processes within FOT, and regularly completed projects to support licensees of the FOT brand. I personally generated the templates for customer documentation using the modified Markup language within iSell, and conducted standups and code reviews for business automations using VBA and Power Automate.

                <h5>Process Consultancy</h5>
                <p>
                    I completed some Freelance Consultancy work for the 'Social Ignition' brand. This is a business that provides consultancy, management and content creation for numerous online social media platforms, but primarily focuses on X, Instagram and YouTube. I enabled rapid growth of the business by mapping their processes, understanding their product deliverables and software-stack. By leveraging project management platform Click-Up and automating repeated human processes with Zapier, I was able to streamline their client onboarding process, which in turn drove an increase of productivity and profit. I used Google Script to manipulate financial data, generating digestible month-by-month statistics granting channel managers at-a-glance insights to monthly running costs without the need to pay for ongoing dashboard licensing.

                <h4>Castons Consulting Ltd & CCAS Ltd <span>March 22 - April 23</span></h4>
                <h5>IT Manager</h5>
                <p>
                    I maintained all digital and physical technology across multiple locations, including both the Ipswich and London offices and temporary offices at various NHS hospitals. I wrote the IT policies and procedures (such as procurement of software, data processing and SLAs) and worked with several internal stakeholders including department heads, directors and external partners to ensure that their IT processes were effective and maximise efficiency. I procured and refreshed the end-user technology and positively impacted user attitude to cyber security. I introduced regular phishing exercises and implemented email security software, leading to an 80%+ reduction in management of email-defense related tasks for the IT team and becoming a celebrated <a href="https://www.egress.com/media/nq1d1caz/castons_customer_story.pdf">case study</a> for Egress and SpearShield’s email security package. I managed a multi-million pound data collection service which is still being used at numerous NHS hospitals using Azure and Office solutions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time at Castons, I managed the decommissioning of our physical servers in favour of a fully cloud-based Azure Remote Desktop solution as well as the implementation of a cloud-based telephony system with mobile app integration to enable consistent workflows for our hybrid workforce. I created a company intranet using SharePoint to streamline communications and collaborated with the Document Controller to gather a library of popular and essential documents to ensure that data was both secure and accessible to Castons employees, driving increased productivity. I successfully reduced human-based risks by enacting company wide MFA and best practice password and account management, securing Cyber Essentials certification.

                <p>
                    At Orwell, I worked as a 2nd/3rd line technician on the Helpdesk. I was responsible for rolling out the MobileIron MDM to the fleet of android mobiles and tablets, as well as imaging new PC’s, laptops and Surfaces. Patching network ports and monitoring the firewall was a regular activity and maintaining the printers over the MPLS network at numerous care homes was an essential part of my role. I created the Intranet used by the organisation using Classic SharePoint, and assisted in the scripting for the Modern SharePoint sites.

                <h5>ICT Support Assistant <span>until March 21</span></h5>
                <p>
                    In this role I worked as a 1st line technician. I completed the initial Helpdesk ticket logging and first phone call fixes. I programmed a training tool to assist the cleaners and I also managed the backend of the public facing website. I used Intune to manage the mobile phone fleet and authored JSON scripts to automate the mobile phone deployment process.

                <p>
                    During my time at Uni, I learned a lot about collaboration, independence and discipline. I learned how to design content, how to lead others, how to manage deadlines and how to deliver the desired outcome within a set scope. Aside from all the technical skills I picked up, the most important thing I discovered was the way we look at processes. Each and every process can be broken down and challenged. When we manipulate the building blocks of a process we affect the outcomes, and games, much like real-world situations, can be crafted to make a desireable outcome. Most of the success in my career can be attributed to this philosophy.
